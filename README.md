# What is it?
Well...Now you can store your bike on the back of Redneck's brand new & improved Whelen Pack! I mean, who wouldn't want to put your bike on the back of your vehicle. like, don't put it inside the vehicle, that's too crammed!!
*(this is still in beta stages, feel free to submit any issues or PRs)*

# Functionality
- Grab your bike, ride to the back of the car, and press 'K' to attach. (to deattach, do it from inside the car)
